# 🔐 Twilio OTP + JWT Auth Security Checklist

This document outlines all essential security practices for a modular Twilio-based OTP and JWT authentication system.

---

## ✅ OTP Security

* [ ] Store OTPs only in **Redis**, not in persistent DB
* [ ] Use `SET key value EX 300 NX` to prevent OTP reuse
* [ ] Generate OTPs using `crypto.randomInt` or equivalent (NOT `Math.random()`)
* [ ] Set OTP expiry to **max 5 minutes**
* [ ] Never log raw OTPs in any logs (use masked versions)
* [ ] Validate OTPs before comparison (must be 4-6 digit strings)

---

## ✅ JWT Security

* [ ] Use strong 256-bit secret or RS256 public/private key pair
* [ ] Set `exp` claim (15–30 mins ideal) and rotate tokens if needed
* [ ] Add standard claims: `iss`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`
* [ ] Store JWTs in **HTTP-only cookies** (preferred) or secured localStorage
* [ ] Never expose secret keys in frontend or logs
* [ ] Use `jsonwebtoken` or `jose` with strict verification options

---

## ✅ Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

* [ ] Rate limit OTP requests per **IP** (e.g., 10 per 10 min)
* [ ] Rate limit OTP requests per **phone number** (e.g., 3 per 10 min)
* [ ] Temporarily block abusive IPs (e.g., `ip_blocked:<ip>`, EX 900 sec)
* [ ] Temporarily block abusive phones (`phone_blocked:<phone>`, EX 900 sec)
* [ ] Combine IP + phone + user-agent if needed for better fingerprinting
* [ ] Use Redis TTL keys to track request windows cleanly

---

## ✅ Input Validation

* [ ] Validate `phone` using `validator.isMobilePhone()`
* [ ] Validate `otp` using regex: `/^\d{4,6}$/`
* [ ] Validate `email`, `username`, etc. before usage
* [ ] Sanitize and escape all incoming input
* [ ] Prevent malformed values from becoming Redis keys or DB queries

---

## ✅ Twilio Usage

* [ ] Do NOT log Twilio `authToken` or `SID`
* [ ] Use environment variables to store Twilio credentials
* [ ] Monitor Twilio account usage (set alerts & limits)
* [ ] Use **Twilio Verify API** for higher security (optional, but safer)

---

## ✅ Logging & Monitoring

* [ ] Use **Winston** or **Pino** for centralized, structured logging
* [ ] Mask sensitive logs (`+91******1234` instead of full phone)
* [ ] Log important events: OTP requests, IP/phone blocks, token issued
* [ ] Avoid logging headers or request bodies in production

---

## ✅ Web Security Headers & Practices

* [ ] Use `helmet` middleware in Express for HTTP headers
* [ ] Enforce HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., Let’s Encrypt)
* [ ] Use CORS with whitelisted domains only
* [ ] Enable `SameSite=Strict` for cookies
* [ ] Set `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on all cookies

---

## ✅ Frontend Token Handling (if not using cookies)

* [ ] NEVER store JWTs in `window` or inline script
* [ ] If using `localStorage`, make sure frontend is protected from XSS
* [ ] Use CSP (Content Security Policy) to block inline scripts

---

## ✅ Additional Considerations

* [ ] Use `.env` for all secrets; never hard-code
* [ ] Rotate JWT secrets & Twilio keys periodically
* [ ] Write unit tests to simulate abuse scenarios (e.g., 5 OTPs in 1 minute)
* [ ] Review Redis keys & TTLs regularly
* [ ] Log all auth errors with appropriate HTTP codes (e.g., 429, 401, 400)
